**Caliburn.Micro.Recipes.Filters**

Implementation from Marco Amendola, see his article: 
http://marcoamendola.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/a-caliburn-micro-recipe-filters/

His original fork on Codeplex:

As Caliburn.Micro has moved to github, I decided to put this up as well.

- Modified to work with Caliburn.Micro 2.0.0 
- added type caching.
- Refactored to use a Portable Class Library / Platform dll like Caliburn (only have a NET45 platform version, as I don't have SL / Windows Phone installed)

Enjoy!
